      <title>EZRaffle – An Open Source Raffle Application</title>

      <description>I would like to share that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently uploaded an application I wrote to my GitHub account that can be used to administer raffles. No longer will you have to hand-fill hundreds upon hundreds of tickets for your raffles! EZRaffle will insert as many entries as an entrant is entitled to along with their information. Upon submission, the entrant will optionally be sent an email confirming their entries.
It&amp;rsquo;s written in C# and uses a light-weight SQLite database.</description>

      <title>SQL – The Differences in Joins</title>

      <description>The language I might say I have had the most experience with has been T-SQL. A DML! Transact SQL is a proprietary extension to Structured Query Language and used with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s SQL Server. For the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve hacked together various reports, stored procedures, and jobs to do a range of things. Be it sending daily formatted HTML reports, to using complex queries that update the back end database for business software.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten more involved in the Decred community. I&amp;rsquo;ll elaborate more on my thoughts of what Decred aims to be in an update to this post. Suffice for now to say that its aims are the most admirable I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the space, and having spoken with members of the development team personally, they&amp;rsquo;ve got great backers and it&amp;rsquo;s going to go far.
UPDATE:
In my opinion, three things make Decred the best cryptocurrency at the moment:</description>

      <description>Raspberry Pi Time Machine This week I received a new MacBook Pro 2017 to use as my development machine when &amp;lsquo;on the go&amp;rsquo; (or on the couch, to be more accurate). I also received a larger SSD to replace the boot drive on Desktop PC, and suddenly had a 120GB SSD with no job. I decided to put it to work to hold backups of my new mobile dev machine in the event of the worst case scenario.</description>

      <description>I am currently training for the Network+ certification offered by CompTia. It&amp;rsquo;s a vastly more interesting subject for me to review and familiarize myself with than A+ has been in the past. As for the moment I only have the money for one certification and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to pursue this one first. CompTia Certifications
For anyone else interested in studying up for this or any other CompTia certifications, I highly recommend Professor Messer&amp;rsquo;s YouTube Channel, which can be found here.</description>

      <title>Congress Passes Bill to Repeal Internet Privacy Rules</title>

      <description>You may have heard. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, then you&amp;rsquo;re about to. Which is exciting for you because not having heard is most likely what Congress was hoping for, for nefarious reasons.
Congress recently passed a bill to repeal the Federal Communication Commission&amp;rsquo;s privacy rules for Internet Service Providers (referred to as the common acronym ISPs). These rules never had the opportunity to go into effect, but they would have allowed the average consumer more control over how our ISPs use the data they collect on us.</description>

      <description>Scripting languages and command line interfaces is an area I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus on in 2016. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a part of an online course on Python with Udemy by Jose Portilla that I highly recommend. I&amp;rsquo;m also diving into Powershell at work to become more familiar with remote Azure AD management. Familiarity with Powershell scripting will make me much more powerful in my domain.
Over the weekend I decided to get a little more comfortable with the command line interface with my Mac.</description>

      <description>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do but have not as of yet, is to get involved in Open Source development. The biggest reason for being scared off was fear of being the new guy, or committing to a project and then being pigeonholed into something I&amp;rsquo;d find boring, such as writing documentation or quality assurance testing. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I know this stuff is important. I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried either of these so it could be something I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy, but I really want to focus on new features instead of improving upon old code.</description>

      <description>As most of you know, for most of my life I was very anti-Apple. The price difference between an Apple product and the rest of the competition struck me as insane. &amp;ldquo;I can get way better specs for that price!&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d think to myself, if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actively debating with someone.
This perception started to change when I got my first smartphone. It was a hand-me-down iPhone 3G from my father.</description>

** Photoswipe Album **
I visited Osaka for a few days and stayed at my stepmom&amp;rsquo;s friend, Naomi&amp;rsquo;s house. They have two kids, Kizuna, 4, and So, 2 years old.
They are really good kids, although really noisy! It had been 3 years since I saw Naomi last.</description>

Not really much to say about this trip. Went to Tokyo, saw the imperial gardens (which are huge) and took the subway to Aoyama, walked to Roppongi.

Imperial Palace gardens. There were a lot of people just bumming around napping under the trees and such.</description>

Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last updated. I used the JR pass to go afield and didn&amp;rsquo;t have room to carry my laptop and fit enough clothes to last.

      <description>From Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko to the Top (The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) So when I was planning for my trip to see the area around Mt. Fuji, I never really thought i&amp;rsquo;d end up climbing it.
Mr. Takata helped me to plan the fastest route of trains to Kawaguchiko, which leads up to the 5th station of Mt.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) The past few days I have been exploring Chiba and the Tokyo area, which is huge. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Akihabara, Ueno Park, Tokyo National Museum, Tokyo Station, Wadakura fountain park, Shinjuku, Chiba-Minato, and Chiba Castle. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of pictures,but I will try to organize them the best I can and see what I can do.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could have found better hosts to stay with in Japan than the Takatas! They are very nice and helpful to me. I love having discussions with Mr. Takata. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot from him so far; he is a very smart and interesting person to talk to.</description>

Here is my room. It&amp;rsquo;s small but really nice. You can&amp;rsquo;t see it, but across the room from the dresser is a closet where the futon I sleep on at night is stored.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) I went to bed around 9:00 pm last night, and got up around 6! No jet lag so far really.
Today I decided I would go to Chiba City Zoo. It&amp;rsquo;s close by. Only had to take a monorail for about 15 minutes. Mr. Takata explained to me how to use the transportation system and lent me a Pasmo card, which is a card you can load up with money in order to avoid buying tickets.</description>

I met up with Mr. Takata, and from there we drove to his house in Chiba City, which was about a 40 minute drive.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Hey everyone. I figured I would make a introduction blog post for you all for some background informations.
So I&amp;rsquo;m Scott. 18 years of age.
I just finished my first year of college! Definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t the crazy party all the time college that most everyone I knew was looking forward too, but I got some good grades in and that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to count in the long run.</description>
