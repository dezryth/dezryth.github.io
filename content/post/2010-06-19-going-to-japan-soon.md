_(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!)_

Hey everyone. I figured I would make a introduction blog post for you all for some background informations.

So I&#8217;m Scott. 18 years of age.

I just finished my first year of college! Definitely wasn&#8217;t the crazy party all the time college that most everyone I knew was looking forward too, but I got some good grades in and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to count in the long run. Back on topic.. I completed two semesters of Japanese and did pretty well. I feel confident in my japanese language skills so far and shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about getting completely lost while i&#8217;m over there&#8230;. haha

This is my first time to a foreign country on my own!  I am really excited for this! Although a little nervous at the same time too, but I am looking forward to having this awesome experience, no matter what happens! BRING IT ON YAKUZA! hahaha just kidding..

I am leaving on the 20th, which is this sunday. In an hour from me typing this, it&#8217;ll be saturday. So i have about 36 hours till i&#8217;m off!

I will be staying with Mr. and Mrs. Takata at their home in Chiba City, which is in the Chiba prefecture of the Kanto Region in japan. I&#8217;d like to thank them again for being so kind and allowing me to stay! It is about an hour train ride to Tokyo.  TOKYO.

I can already smell the Ramen. Yes, with a capital R.

While I am in Japan, I can activate a Japan Rail pass that will allow me to ride any JR Train to anywhere as many times as I need within 2 weeks time! I will probably knock out most of the sight seeing during this period, but I also hope to get to know the local area while I am in Chiba City as well!

I will have a camera, and you will be seeing many pictures. Maybe even a few videos! I&#8217;ll see what I can do. Thanks for reading my blog! You haven&#8217;t seen anything yet!
