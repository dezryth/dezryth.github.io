_(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!)_

I went to bed around 9:00 pm last night, and got up around 6! No jet lag so far really.

Today I decided I would go to Chiba City Zoo. It&#8217;s close by&#8212; Only had to take a monorail for about 15 minutes. Mr. Takata explained to me how to use the transportation system and lent me a Pasmo card, which is a card you can load up with money in order to avoid buying tickets.

Finding the zoo after getting off the monorail was very easy. The bridge to the monorail station led directly to the zoo!

Here are just a few of the photos I took while there. If you&#8217;d like to see more of them ( I have about 100) then visit this url &#8211; http://www.flickr.com/photos/51354098@N03/sets/72157624205557189/

Today was a good day! I learned how to navigate a little, and got to utilize my japanese skills in the field! PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD ME! YESSSSSSS.

Have a great day everyone!
