_(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!)_

Honestly, I don&#8217;t think I could have found better hosts to stay with in Japan than the Takatas! They are Â very nice and helpful to me. I love having discussions with Mr. Takata. I&#8217;ve learned a lot from him so far; he is a very smart and interesting person to talk to. Mrs. Takata is also the same way. They both test me in japanese and keep me on my toes all the time, and it really helps. Mrs. Takata is also an awesome cook!

I am so thankful to them for everything they have done for me!

Here they are:

And for anyone who wanted to compare Mr. Takata vs. Mr. Miyagi&#8230; haha:

Mr. Takata is way cooler by far.
