_(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!)_

Hey guys.

This is my first blog, and i&#8217;m not entirely sure how to use all the features, but i can post! Thats the main thing.

The name of the blog comes from my name in katakana directly translated to english.

**スコット -> Su ko tto**

**Cool huh? Not really, but it was either that or Scottgoes2japan, which sounds like the title of a lame movie.**

This blog is for my 2010 summer trip to Japan! I will be staying for approximately three weeks and will be using this blog to share with all of you back home who are interested!

I would like to thank my grandfather, Gordon Christian, my father, and step mother who have supported my interest  in Japanese culture and made this trip possible.

I would also like to greatly thank in advance Mr. and Mrs. Takata for allowing me to stay at their place in Chiba City! I am really looking forward to meeting you!

I will update as frequently as I am able! Hope you guys enjoy the blog!

Make sure to share the link with anyone you feel may want to see it!
