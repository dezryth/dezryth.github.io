I am currently training for the Network+ certification offered by [CompTia][1]. It&#8217;s a vastly more interesting subject for me to review and familiarize myself with than A+ has been in the past. As for the moment I only have the money for one certification and I&#8217;ve decided to pursue this one first.<figure style="width: 167px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

For anyone else interested in studying up for this or any other CompTia certifications, I highly recommend Professor Messer&#8217;s YouTube Channel, which can be found [here][3].
