      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium, Kobe
** Photoswipe Album **
I visited Osaka for a few days and stayed at my stepmom&amp;rsquo;s friend, Naomi&amp;rsquo;s house. They have two kids, Kizuna, 4, and So, 2 years old.
They are really good kids, although really noisy! It had been 3 years since I saw Naomi last.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Imperial Palace Garden and Roppongi
Not really much to say about this trip. Went to Tokyo, saw the imperial gardens (which are huge) and took the subway to Aoyama, walked to Roppongi.
** Photoswipe album **
Imperial Palace gardens. There were a lot of people just bumming around napping under the trees and such.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last updated. I used the JR pass to go afield and didn&amp;rsquo;t have room to carry my laptop and fit enough clothes to last.

      <description>Mt. Fuji: From Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko to the Top (The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) So when I was planning for my trip to see the area around Mt. Fuji, I never really thought i&amp;rsquo;d end up climbing it.
Mr. Takata helped me to plan the fastest route of trains to Kawaguchiko, which leads up to the 5th station of Mt.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) The past few days I have been exploring Chiba and the Tokyo area, which is huge. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Akihabara, Ueno Park, Tokyo National Museum, Tokyo Station, Wadakura fountain park, Shinjuku, Chiba-Minato, and Chiba Castle. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of pictures,but I will try to organize them the best I can and see what I can do.</description>

      <description>The Takatas (The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could have found better hosts to stay with in Japan than the Takatas! They are very nice and helpful to me. I love having discussions with Mr. Takata. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot from him so far; he is a very smart and interesting person to talk to.</description>

      <description>Chiba City (The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Here are a few pictures of where I am staying in Chiba City.
Here is my room. It&amp;rsquo;s small but really nice. You can&amp;rsquo;t see it, but across the room from the dresser is a closet where the futon I sleep on at night is stored.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) I went to bed around 9:00 pm last night, and got up around 6! No jet lag so far really.
Today I decided I would go to Chiba City Zoo. It&amp;rsquo;s close by. Only had to take a monorail for about 15 minutes. Mr. Takata explained to me how to use the transportation system and lent me a Pasmo card, which is a card you can load up with money in order to avoid buying tickets.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) I&amp;rsquo;m in Japan! The flight was smooth, and when I arrived at Narita Airport I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble getting through customs.
I met up with Mr. Takata, and from there we drove to his house in Chiba City, which was about a 40 minute drive.</description>

      <description>(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!) Hey everyone. I figured I would make a introduction blog post for you all for some background informations.
So I&amp;rsquo;m Scott. 18 years of age.
I just finished my first year of college! Definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t the crazy party all the time college that most everyone I knew was looking forward too, but I got some good grades in and that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to count in the long run.</description>
