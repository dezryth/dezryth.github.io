      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pretty busy year!
I&amp;rsquo;ve earned the following certifications:
 Comptia A+ Comptia Project+ Advanced HTML5 &amp;amp; CSS3 Specialist CIW AXELOS ITIL Foundation  The company I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for, Fay Servicing, converted me from a contractor to a full-time employee, which has been very exciting! I&amp;rsquo;m blessed to work with a wonderful team of software developers. Our manager, Mark Petersen, is a very talented developer and manager and his constructive criticism in code reviews and advice in meetings has been very helpful in informing my software development growth.</description>
