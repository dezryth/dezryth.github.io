      <description>My proposal passed with 76.3% approval! ðŸŽ‰
I promised transparency with my proposal and I intend to update this post with insight into the work over the months and a picture of the invoice sent to Decred&amp;rsquo;s CMS system each month. This will be updated over time. Please bear with me as the format and level of description may fluctuate, and keep in mind that this level of disclosure to the public is rare.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve put together some evidence of prior work for review for my proposal on Decred&amp;rsquo;s Politeia governance platform. I am seeking to continue doing marketing work with Decred at events as well as managing the Decred Facebook page.
You can view my proposal here.
Overview Facebook Management Guidelines I want to whip the page into better shape and increase engagement. We&amp;rsquo;ve got metrics to compare to competitor pages, and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t beat them at being one of the most compelling cryptocurrency pages to follow.</description>
